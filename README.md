This is a bash shell script which can do several operations on a matrix provided via stdin --  
  
dims: return the dimensions  
transpose: reflect the elements along the main diagonal  
mean: output the mean of each column  
add: add two matrices  
multiply: matrix multiplication  
  
You can run it with ./matrix [operation]
      
All operations take one additional filename parameter, except for add and multiply, which take two
